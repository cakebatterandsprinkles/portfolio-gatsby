I bet you have a computer, a smartphone or a tablet that's connected to the internet. How do I know? I know it because that's how you are reading this piece of text that I wrote from my own computer. So you and I, we are sharing information somehow. This article will exactly be about this: our connection to each other.

We have to understand some other stuff before we get to the internet and world wide web though. Let's start.

**Computer Networks:**

Think of a single computer, that is connected to electricity and nothing else. This is called **a stand-alone computer**. A standalone computer is a computer that is not connected to any other computer. It might have some peripheral devices attached to it (printer, keyboard, mouse etc.), but it can't communicate with any other computer. It literally stands alone.

When 2 or more computers are connected to each other, they become a **computer network.** The connection is generally provided by a cable or radio waves. So you and I are part of a network.

There are some type of networks, and they differ according to the area they cover. For example in a **Local Area Network (LAN)** computers are physically close to each other, they are in the same office building, school, or university campus. Only devices that are allowed to use this network can use this network.

In a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** computers can be physically away from each other. A WAN covers a wider area, an entire city, a country or even the whole world. A WAN simply connects LANs to each other. The internet is a worldwide public WAN. Signals in this network can be encrypted, but it is still less secure than a LAN. WANs also require more specialized devices and data has to travel for long distances, so WANs are more expensive to build.

**WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) network** uses radio waves instead of cables. All WiFi signals go through the same place to reach a wider network, and that place is called the **Wireless Access Point(WAP)**. All WiFi traffic flows through the WAP.

**Network Hardware:**

**Ethernet:**

**The Anatomy of a Frame:**

**The TCP/IP Protocol Stack and Routers**

**DNS (Domain Name System)**
