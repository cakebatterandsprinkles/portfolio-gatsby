Is everything associated with computers "digital"? If not, what is digital and what is analog? Is digital better than analog or vice versa?

There is so much confusion around these two terms. This article will try to answer some of these questions.

The word "digital" comes from "digitalis", which means finger or toe in Latin. Since fingers and toes are used for counting things from the very early ages of humanity, "digit" at some point sort of gained another meaning, which is "numerals below 10" (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). That way "digital" came to have a meaning of "using digits".

In computers, everything is bits, and bits can only be 1's and 0's. They cannot be anything in between. Either there is electricity in the wire, or there isn't. Either your lights are on, of off(assuming you're not using a dimmer).

The words "analog", "analogy" and "analogous" all come from the same roots, and all of them are used to describe "the likeness of things". For example, most of the time of you make an analogy, you are trying to find a similar but more relatable example of the same thing, so that you can describe the original thing better.

Analog data is the data with continuous change. If we are using numbers 0 and 1 to define our data, if our data is digital, we can encode our data with 0 or 1, whereas if our data is analog, it can be encoded with 0, 1 and anything in between those. (1.25, 1.332, 1.99, whatever.)

Example time! If you buy some acrylic paint, mix them and paint a flower, your painting is analog. How you mix your colors, how you hold your brush, the position of your hand, everything matters when you are doing an analog painting. If you paint a picture using a computer, your painting is digital (each tiny square that form your painting, which are called pixels, have a specific binary data). If you sing your favorite song in the shower, your song is analog. When you are cooking, if you're following a recipe strictly by measuring everything, your cooking is digital. If you are adding spices and vegetables on a whim without following a set of rules, then your cooking is analog. You can perfectly replicate a digital thing, but replicating an analog thing is very, very hard, because how much you try to imitate it, there will always be slight differences. In analog, you have infinite number of choices, but in a digital setting, you have limited amount of choices.

The world surrounding us is mostly analog.

Technology until around 40 years ago was mostly analog as well. When I was a child, we had a telephone in our house that did not work when it was unplugged. These old telephones
