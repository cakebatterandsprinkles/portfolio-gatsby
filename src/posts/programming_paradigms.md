A "paradigm" is a thought pattern, a way of thinking, a way of looking at something. For example, there were times humanity believed the Earth was at the center of the universe, and other celestial bodies like the Sun and the Moon revolved around the Earth. This was called the "geocentric model". This model at least accepted the Earth as a sphere in constrast to the older flat-Earth model.

Around 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus observed the sky with his naked eyes and discovered the Sun was the center of the world and the other celestial bodies revolved around it. He did not have the tools to prove he was right, but the idea was put out there, so in 1600s another great scientist named Galileo Galilei built a telescope, and came to the same conclusion, this time with data in his hands. This idea of the Sun being the center and other planets were revolving around it was called the "heliocentic model". Now, although it took some time and a lot of suffering of some great scientists (Copernicus died shortly after he published his theory, but after publishing his data, Galileo was charged with heresy and faced Roman inquisition by the Catholic church.) they opened up a new era, a new way of thinking. Rather than accepting whatever was in the ancient texts and Bible, another method of thinking was born: gathering data by observing and studying nature, forming hypotheses, designing and performing experiments to test these hypotheses and drewing conclusions from the end results, the scientific revolution. So their work resulted with what we can call a "paradigm shift". It changed one way of thinking to another.

In computer science, programming paradigm term refers to the ways of programming. It is not as strict as the scientific revolution, it is basically programmers choosing a way of doing things.

All programming languages need to follow a strategy when they are implemented. Not all programming languages are created the same way (if they were, we wouldn't need so many of them anyway). Each language has it's own limitations. So how the language is built is extremely important when it comes to paradigms it can use. If a class concept doesn't exist in a language, you won't be able to use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm with it.

So most programming paradigms can be classified inside 2 main titles: imperative and declarative. Let's check them out.

1. Imperative programming paradigm:

The word "imperative" comes from Latin word "imperare", which means "to give orders, command". (The word "emperor" also comes from the same root.)

In an imperative programming paradigm, you have to tell the computer what to do and how to do it step by step. The order of your commands also matter, because the final results will change accordingly.

2. Declarative programming paradigm:

In a declarative programming paradigm, you tell the computer what to do, but you don't explain it step by step.
