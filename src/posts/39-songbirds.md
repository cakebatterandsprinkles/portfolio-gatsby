#### The origins of this article

I've been interested in songbirds (and birds in general) for a few years now. My interest in them started with the severe allergic reactions I had to my favorite animals, cats and dogs, so my favorite had to change. (Don't judge me, it's something I can't control and I work with what I have.) I realized I had no allergic reactions to birds, so I became ecstatic for I could actually have a pet that I can hug and not die during. (Soon after I learned that birds don't like hugging that much. This fact didn't stop me.)

Around 3 years ago, we had the privilidge to get a [green pacific parrotlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_parrotlet). We got a huge cage for his tiny ass and lot's and lot's of toys, and as any owner of a happy bird, his cheerful behaviour patterns began to attract our interest.

First of all, we live very close to a park, so we have many birds around. Most common ones are finches, cardinals, blue jays, mockingbirds, red-winged blackbirds, and doves. They come close, some even entered the house several times when I'm not looking. With time we made an interesting observation, our tiny little parrotlet never had an interest in any of these bird's calls, or their image. He simply doesn't care. I'm not even sure that he understands that those are birds too. But, whenever we opened a pre-recorded video of him, or a sound recording of other parrotlets, he starts chirping, pacing, and all the other bird movements. He also started imitating our language, saying some stuff that resembled "pretty bird", "hi baby", and ocassionally gave us little kisses.
