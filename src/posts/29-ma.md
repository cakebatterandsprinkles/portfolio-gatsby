Human brains are amazing. One of the most compelling qualities that makes them so amazing is the continuous adaptation ability to ever changing requirements of the world around them, also known as **[neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)**. The human brain can change its functional and structural organization to fit in the needs of its environment. It can be successful in terms of increasing its chances of survival (which is referred to as **[adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation)**), or unsuccessful (also called **[maladaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptation)**).

Not all adaptations are beneficial for the human, and there are many examples of this so called **maladaptive plasticity**. **[The writer's cramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_cramp#:~:text=Writer's%20cramp%20or%20focal%20hand,hand%20use%2C%20such%20as%20writing.)** (or **[the musician's cramp](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2000/11/brain-blame-musicians-cramp)**, which is a very similar condition) [are thought to be caused by a dysfunctional reorganization of the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724923/), and they both result with involuntary muscle contractions in fine motor control of the hands. (Which can also be reversed by a method called **sensory motor retuning**, read [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7942) article if you're interested.) There are also syndromes that involve sensory information that shouldn't be there, such as the **phantom limb syndrome** (which is recurring sensations, like tickling, itching or pain from a limb that is lost), or tinnitus following a hearing loss. The reason for these syndromes are still unknown, but dysfunctional cortical reorganization is one of the culprits.

However, I must point out that most adaptations are pretty useful. Think of a person that learns anything. It can be a perceptual, a motor or a cognitive skill, or a mixture of these. The best (and the most common) examples are musicians, which learn a motor and cognitive skill by extensive hours and years of practice. Their brain adapts to this demand by modifying the motor, tactile and auditory regions. There is also [a study](https://www.nature.com/articles/24075?source=post_page/) that suggests music traning (especially at a younger age) modifies other regions in the brain, therefore improving some other cognitive functions, such as verbal memory.

We experience the world around us by tiny **[receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_neuron)**, whether it be sensing light, pressure, temperature or sound, it doesn't matter. We feel the light touch of the wind on our skin, and the heat of another person's body and the sense of pressure when we are hugging each other. We smell a beautiful flower and hear the birds chirping. Our brains collect all this sensory information and analyzes it, and even responds to it if it needs to. In cases of sensory loss (such as blindness, deafness, loss of a limb, etc.), our brain seems to adapt by assigning new functions to the neurons that were responsible for that sensory information. Some studies suggest that this results with enhanced performance on other tasks. A good example of this is blindness, the performance of tactile and auditory tasks in blind individuals is enhanced. [It even happens after blindfolding sighted individuals just for a few days.](http://tmslab.org/includes/alvaro_3.pdf) This probably has a very good reason, if you cannot use your eyes, you use other sensory organs to give you information about your environment, and as the synapses in the visual cortex get weeker, synapses in the auditory and tactile cortex get stronger. And synapses influence the neighboring neurons too.

The bottom line is, the existance or nonexistance of things around it changes a human brain. As humans, we fear the word "empty"- a depressed person fears the "empty" feeling that comes occasionally, an artist fears the "empty" canvas, and we all fear the "empty" refrigerator. But if a space, or the emptiness is not forced to the human but purposefully created by it, it can become an adaptative quality that eventually benefits the person experiencing it. The empty space creates an enhanced experience of whatever is taking the space.

And this article is about the purposeful non-existence of things.

#### The concept of 'ma', the purposeful emptiness

"Ma" is the Japanese concept of space, which is also referred to as "negative space", "interval" or "gap". Although it is a space, it is not considered to be actually "empty". As it was deliberately, purposefully left as a space, it contributes to that piece as much as the other accompanying elements. The negative spaces allow thoughts, relationships and functions to exist.

Think of music. The places where no sound exists also contributes to the overall experience of it. Think of a bowl. The reason why it can hold anything in the first place is that it has an empty space inside of it. Essentially houses are tiny closed boxes that are surrounded with walls, but what makes the livingspace is the empty areas inside of it. Or simply think of this text, how hard would reading this be if there were no spaces in between words?

Ma can be reflected to almost anything: If we are talking about humans, it can be personal space, or silent gaps in the conversation. Not avoiding the gaps allows things to be intentional. If you talk less, you can mean more. If we're talking about a room, it can be the space between things you own. Not avoiding gaps in your living space can allow you to move and clean more efficiently, and even be more grateful about the things you own.

#### Empty spaces in art

"Ma" is crucial for some art forms. Without the negative space, the expression of the feelings the artworks want to relay get lost before reaching the audience.

**[Sumi-e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_wash_painting)** is a type of East Asian brush paintings that use the same black ink in different concentrations, which results in monochrome ink paintings. It is almost 2000 years old. The technique originally stemmed from China during Tang Dynasty (618–907), and was later introduced to Japan. The earliest practitioners of this art form were Buddhist monks, and it is not very surprising, as the demands of the technique almost completely match the demands of being a Buddhist monk: concentration, calmness, clarity and simplicity. Both require a tranquil mind.

The artworks are done on rice paper, which is also very appropriate for this art form. As it is very thin and fragile, the artist has to work with confident brush strokes. There are almost no chances of undoing what has been done "wrong". Every brush stroke has to be intentional, but in a way the brush also has it's own mind, so it can create unexpected textures. This art form doesn't try to reflect or recreate the subject in every detail, but aims to capture the spirit of it.

Sometimes the negative space contains calligraphy and the artist's stamp in a beautiful red color, but it is not a must. Check ["Landscape"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_by_Sessh%C5%AB) from Sesshū for reference.

Some other artists that can be checked out for their sumi-e paintings are: [Hasegawa Tōhaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasegawa_T%C5%8Dhaku), [Ma Yuan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Yuan_(painter)>), [Li Cheng](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Cheng_(painter)>).

**[Ikebana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikebana)** is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. Etymologically, it is a combination of two japanese words, **ikeru** (which means to have life, to be living, or to arrange) and **hana** (which means flower). So it can also be translated as "giving life to flowers". Another common aspect of ikebana is **minimalism**, the pieces are not composed of many elements, but the space is used in such a way that gives flowers life and enhance the longevity of their beauty.

#### Meditation and mindfullness

Mindfullness is being aware of yourself and the things surrounding you. Meditation is a form of turning down the volume of the outside world, creating an empty space inside, so your thoughts will have some space to grow. Although they are different things, they actually go hand in hand. You don't necessarily cut off everything and think of nothing- as human mind rarely is empty and thinking of nothing. It is mostly about being mindful and at that moment, feeling the air and clothings touching your skin, or simply smelling and hearing what is actually around you. The main part of it is being intentional. Not letting things happen to you, but taking control of some simple things you can control, can calm you in ways you can't imagine. Everybody reaches this state of mind in different ways. You can practice being at the moment while doing anything, for example trying to wash the dishes, cook, fold the laundry, or simply just walk as quietly as possible can make every move intentional, as you're not used to doing it. You have to focus on doing things quietly, therefore you cannot focus on anything else, which can clear some space and push things away from you.

#### Conclusion

In this article, I've shared some concepts from throughout the world that embrace and celebrate the negative space of some sorts. Of course, there are many other things and concepts to read and think about that I haven't shared in this article. I leave it out on the table, for there are many other things the reader of this article to explore, only if they'd like to.

May the space be with you!
