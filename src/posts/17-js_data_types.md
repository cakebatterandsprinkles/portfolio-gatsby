### Data Types in JS

The data types in JS can be divided into 2 major categories:

1. **Primitive values:** String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbols(ES6)

   If i make a variable and link a value to it (e.g. var a = 5), it will be stored in a memory. If I make another variable and assign it to the first variable(var b= a), in memory, a copy of the first variable is created and copied to the second variable(in memory, it is var b=5). If you change the first variable after this( eg. a = 10), the second variable created will still be equal to the initial value (b = 5).

2. **Reference values:** Arrays, Object Literals, Functions, Dates, anything else..

   In reference data types, if we create a variable, the variable doesn't actually hold a value, it holds a pointer. When you copy a variable, it's pointer gets copied, not it's value.
