**The very first numbers**

Counting stuff is as ancient as we are. Thousands of years ago, even without a written language, our ancestors were counting stuff by bending their fingers, or pointing out to stones, or making marks with sharp stuff on bones which we now call the **[tally marks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks)** Clusters of five strokes made it more legible, and different groups of people all around the world invented the tally system in slightly different ways, but always with the same logic - clustering 5 strokes in an order.

The **[written language](http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-written-word/)** came later than the spoken language, when humans began to build more permenant social groups and start to grow their own food. I guess at some point somebody thought writing numbers with tally marks took very, very long when the numbers get bigger, and it was cumbersome for the person who was reading it as well. So at some point, humans decided to use symbols to indicate certain numbers, and these symbols are called **the numerals.** (Thank you previous humans. We couldn't have made it to this point with the tally marks.)

At some point Romans invented their own numerals. They used selected letters from their alphabet to indicate certain numbers. For example "I" was one, "V" was 5, "X" was 10, "L" was 50, "C" was a hundred, "D" was five hundred and "M" was one thousand. Moreover, they invented a method, when you write multiple symbols,

Now, the tally mark counting system is a unary numeral system, because each number is symbolized by a single line, and one in every five line is oblique. But all numbers are

**Remember the time we invented zero?**
