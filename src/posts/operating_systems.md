The operating system (OS for short) is the most important software that runs on a computer. Without an opearting system, a computer wouldn't be able to work.

Think of all the hardware as roads. The softwares (different applications, programs) you run at your computer are all trucks, they carry data from place to place, they have somewhere they must go to. And guess who's controlling the traffic lights, makes sure everyone gets to wherever they need to go, but in order: the OS. OS is the great conductor of this orchestra. You run different programs at the same time, and all of them works. They all use RAM and CPU and the OS makes it all happen, making sure they don't crash into each other.

Not all electronic devices have an operating system. Think of a microvawe oven. It has a simple hardware structure, certain buttons that do certain things, and the user decides what to do with it. Also you make it do one thing at a time. You could write an operating system for it too, but it would be unnecessary and it would make the microwave ovens more expensive and complex than they need to be. So a single hard-wired program works for devices like that.

All computers come with a pre-installed operating system. You can either use the OS that comes with your computer (which is the most commonly used option), or you could change it to another one you like better. Modern opertaing systems come with a GUI (Graphical USer Interface). A GUI whatever you see on the display screen of your computer when you open a program, that let's you do stuff with using buttons etc. The purpose of a GUI is to make a software easier for humans to use, but yes you can use a software without a GUI.

The most common OS's are the Windows family (developed by Microsoft), the Macintosh family (developed by Apple) and the UNIX family (developed by a lot of individuals, corporations and collaborators).

1. Microsoft Windows

   These operating systems are

   Windows was created in the 1980s by Microsoft. Many different versions of it was released, such as Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007). Windows comes pre-loaded on most new computers, and it is the most popular OS.

2. macOS

3. Linux
