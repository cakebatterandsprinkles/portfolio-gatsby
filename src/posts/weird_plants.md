I really wanted to write about plants for a very long time. They are everywhere. If there's water somewhere, there are also plants. We walk on them, breathe their pollens, eat them, showcase them in our homes, but we know so little about them.

If you're curious enough, you did ask to yourself, why are leaves of different plants in different shapes, sizes and colors? How does this flower smell so good?How did that tree grow that way? Why do some trees get sick and die while others don't?

We'll first briefly look at how they operate. Then we will look at some weirdest plants from the different corners of the world that seem to come from a fiction novel. Of course they are weird for the people who are not native to their habitats.
